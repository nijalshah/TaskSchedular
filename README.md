Introduction
The Task Scheduler project is a web application designed to help users manage and schedule tasks in a calendar interface. It allows users to create, view, delete, and mark tasks as completed. This project provides an intuitive way to handle task management for personal or professional purposes, offering a dynamic and interactive approach to keeping track of deadlines, pending tasks, and completed tasks. Users can also navigate between different months in the calendar to view scheduled tasks for any given time period.

Problem Domain
In today's fast-paced world, managing tasks efficiently is a common challenge. Many people struggle to keep track of important tasks, deadlines, and commitments, leading to confusion, missed deadlines, and unorganized schedules. Without proper tools to visualize tasks, it becomes increasingly difficult to manage time effectively, especially when handling multiple responsibilities.

The problem domain of this project focuses on developing a task management solution that:

Allows users to easily schedule, track, and view tasks on a monthly calendar.
Notifies users of scheduled, pending, and completed tasks.
Provides a clear visual representation of tasks for effective time management.
Solution Domain
The Task Scheduler application aims to provide a user-friendly platform for task management. The core functionalities include:

Task creation: Users can add new tasks with a specific date and completion status.
Task management: Users can mark tasks as completed or pending and delete tasks when necessary.
Calendar visualization: Tasks are displayed in a monthly calendar format, and users can navigate between months to manage their schedules.
Task status indicators: Tasks are color-coded to indicate their current status (scheduled in blue, pending in yellow, and completed in green).
Task notifications: When a task is added, deleted, or updated, the user is notified.
This solution helps users stay organized and plan their daily or weekly tasks effectively, making it easier to handle deadlines and tasks in an organized manner.

Technology
The Task Scheduler web application utilizes the following technologies:

Frontend:

HTML5: To structure the content and layout of the web pages.
CSS3: For styling the website, creating an interactive and visually appealing design.
JavaScript: To handle user interactions, manage the calendar logic, and update the user interface dynamically.
AJAX / Fetch API: To interact with the backend and retrieve, add, or delete tasks without reloading the page.
Backend:

Flask: A lightweight Python web framework used to build the backend API and serve the web pages. Flask handles routing, serves static files (CSS/JS), and processes data for task management.
Python: The programming language used to build the backend logic and process task data.
Data Storage:

JSON (in-memory): Task data is temporarily stored in memory as JSON objects. In a production environment, a database would be used for persistent storage.
Browser Compatibility: The project is designed to work across modern web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.

Data Structures Used
The main data structure used in this project is the List of Dictionaries:

List: A list is used to store multiple tasks. Each task is represented by a dictionary, containing properties like the task title, date, and completion status.
Dictionary: A dictionary is used to hold key-value pairs for each task, making it easy to access and modify the task properties (e.g., title, date, and completion status).
The tasks are managed in memory within the tasks list and manipulated using various methods (add, delete, update status).

Methodology
The development of the Task Scheduler project follows an iterative methodology that focuses on building a simple functional prototype and then enhancing it based on feedback and additional requirements:

Initial Planning and Design: Understanding the core requirements of the task scheduler and designing a simple user interface (UI) for the calendar.
Frontend Development: Building the UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calendar structure was created dynamically using JavaScript, and tasks were displayed and managed with interactive buttons.
Backend Development: Creating the Flask API to handle tasksâ€”adding, updating, deleting, and retrieving tasks from the backend.
Integration: Connecting the front-end with the backend via AJAX requests using the Fetch API to enable dynamic task management.
Testing: Testing the functionality of the calendar, task addition, deletion, and completion features. Bug fixes and optimizations were implemented as needed.
Deployment: Finally, the app can be deployed on a web server or hosted locally for demonstration purposes.

Conclusion
The Task Scheduler project successfully addresses the problem of task management by providing a simple yet effective platform for users to track and organize their tasks. Through its interactive calendar interface, users can easily visualize and manage their tasks, ensuring they remain organized and on top of their schedules. By implementing features like task status indicators, deletion, and completion toggling, the app offers a comprehensive solution for day-to-day task management.

Future improvements could involve adding user authentication for personalized task management, integrating with third-party calendars (Google Calendar, Outlook), and introducing a database for persistent data storage.
